the compilers themselves need to compress data using
loops, if statements, bit shifts, interrupts, characters, and, exclusive or, etcetera
so some of your header files can define registers by letters to store the name in less bits
counters. in a flight sim, or chemistry sim, 90% of the data is there already if you use a counter and a well thought out loop
interrupts can be used to optimize the shit out of software run time.
even in producing star filled skys on the computer as the background of the computer at night, loops can make that software run on minimal
hardware and ram

the compiler itself can be used to write device drivers and bug fix by searching the internet in the background, searching the code on the
computer and testing it in the background, and searching documentation online. 

although I kind of think it should mostly be an assembler that changes its code to optimize execution on a chip by chip basis.
