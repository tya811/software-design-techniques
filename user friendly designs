there are several reasons why people spend "too much time on the computer" it's not actually too much time, but its strenuous

the lights are too bright
there is not constant movement and changing of scenery in the background
the lightning brightness and bands never change, you need to simulate the lighting in a forest, under clouds, at night, and during 
an eclipse and a lightning storm, and during all weather conditions

needs Cool Retro Term
there need to be background noises like animals, birds, waves, planes, cars, trains that pop up randomly

this will stop CRT's from burning, so please bring back CRT's and upgrade them to touch screen and keep them boxy and wierd and make 
some of them super nice too, all in the same single computer screen.
